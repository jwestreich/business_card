One of the most valuable skills of a data analyst is being able to use code in creative ways. It's also one of the hardest skills to demonstrate you have if you only have an elevator-pitch amount of time. To solve this, I created a business card while using the ggplot2 package in R. The front of the business card is the visual. The back of the card has the code I wrote to create the card. A quick way to show someone that I not only know R, but can use it to creatively solve problems.
